## Buildings' Approximate True Orthophoto Construction From Satellite Imagery Using Semantic Segmentation and the ICP Algorithm

This repository contains demonstration data and a Jupyter Notebook script for the research paper:  
[Buildings' Approximate True Orthophoto Construction From Satellite Imagery Using Semantic Segmentation and the ICP Algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382700079_Buildings_Approximate_True_Orthophoto_Construction_From_Satellite_Imagery_Using_Semantic_Segmentation_and_the_ICP_Algorithm).

## Instructions

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `demonstration_script.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells one by one.

**Note:**  
Some cells open pop-up windows for manual correction of semantic segmentation.
